Daily Git Workflow

- Begining of your shift
    Pull everyone else's changes at the begining of your shift
        git pull 

- During your shift
    Make your own changes and save files

    Check status of your changes and the repository
        git status

    Add and commit changes
        This
            Add your changes one file at a time 
                git add "[filename.filetype]

            Commit changes 
                git commit -m "[Brief description of changes, Soft cap of 50 characters]"
        Or this
            Add all changes and commit in one line
                git commit -am "[Brief description of changes, Soft cap of 50 characters]"

    Pull changes if someone pushed since your last pull
        git pull

    Push your changes, but if you are working with others warn them first
        git push 

    Wait up to 60 seconds for site to configure read/write access. You will get an internal error
    if you try to access before compleation, this is normal (this is why you warn your coworkers).

    Test changes

    Repeat

- End of your shift
    Try not to push if you can not test as it could cause problems for others
