NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY BEFORE YOU BEGIN MERGING!!!!!

- Checkout the branch that you want to merge into (www)
    git checkout www
    
    - You may have to fetch www first

Dealing with Conflicts

- When you attempt to merge git may say something like:
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in table_of_contents.txt
     Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

- Open up the indicated file and search for the following
    "<<<<<<< HEAD: table_of_contents.txt
     [code from the branch you are merging into (i.e. www)]
     =======
     [code from the branch you are merging from (i.e. webstage)]
     >>>>>>> test_branch_name:table_of_contents.txt"

- Remove what you don't want 

- Commit changes, use commit message to explain how you fixed the conflict

- Continue with merging procedure
